                                               LED FLASHER
                                               
THEORY : We are using LED in day to day life,even without taking it into our consideration. Any time something
electronic lights up,there’s a good chance that an LED is behind it. They come in a huge variety
of sizes, shapes, and colors.
LEDs (that’s “ell-ee-dees”) are a particular type of diode that convert electrical energy into
light. In fact, LED stands for “Light Emitting Diode.” (It does what it says on the tin!) And this
is reflected in the similarity between the diode and LED schematic symbols.
In short, LEDs are like tiny lightbulbs. However, LEDs require a lot less power to light up by
comparison. They’re also more energy efficient, so they don’t tend to get hot like conventional
lightbulbs do (unless you’re really pumping power into them). This makes them ideal for
mobile devices and other low-power applications. Don’t count them out of the high-power
game, though.
so,in this experiment we use a breadboard,ardino,and program it for led flasher.

LERANING AND OBERVATION : From this experiment we learn how to use ardino and breadboard for the first
time and see the basics of electronics and see the working of led flasher.

PROBLEM AND TROUBLESHOOTING : By the begining of this experiment we counter with lot of trouble 
with the ardino and breadboard.These are some that are face by me while working on this experiment
are-:
 1>. while working with the breadboard try not pierce the the breadboard from behind.
 2>. try minimum number of wires is the experiment.
 3>. while coding on the system please make sure that the ardino is connected to the systm by using tools command.
 4>. before write typing the codes please make rough algorithm for that.
 
 PRECAUTION : These are the steps that has to be taken while working on the this experiment -:
               1>. check the LED bulb before using in the experiment.
               2>. check the breadboard that the connection are proper.
               3>. before writing the codes make sure that the ardino must be empty for the codes.
               
 LEARNING OUTCOMES : BY end of experiment we learn basic skills for using ardino.\
                      BLINKING OF LED CAN BE VERIFIED AFTER UPLOADING THE PROGRAM.
